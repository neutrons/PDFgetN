This file is a macro to convert binary NRM files to ASCII that
can be read by PDFgetN using the program OPENGenie (see main
README). 

To use the macro one can either load it within OPENGenie 
using load "nrmtoasc.gcl" or add the load command to the OPENGenie
startup file (usually called 'default_genieinit.gcl').

Once the file is loaded, the conversion is started with

        nrmtoasc inst firstrun lastrun ndet 
   e.g. nrmtoasc LAD  14933    14936   8

The resulting xxxxxxx.asc files can then be processed using PDFgetN.
